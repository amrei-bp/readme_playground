## License

Make it easy for others to know what they can do with your code and add license information into your readme. Often these are placed at the top of the readme for even easier accessibility. They link to the text of the license (not in your repository, but on the web). 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Here are some [markdown license badges](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) you can use.

## Readme editor

Here is an [editor](https://readme.so/editor) that can help you write a markdown readme for your project. Click on the different potential content and it will build a markdown file for you. You can edit on the fly and it'll even show a rendered preview for you. In the end, you can copy the raw code to your project's readme file. 

## Title banner

These you can use for projects, but also for your very own user readme. Easily generated [here](https://leviarista.github.io/github-profile-header-generator/).

## Github summary cards

There are several different ways to display your github stats (if you want to). By default, they will take information off your public repositories, but it is possible to gather information from the private ones too. 

The [Github Profile Summary Cards)(https://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/demo.html), for example, come in a lot of different [themes](https://github.com/vn7n24fzkq/github-profile-summary-cards/blob/main/README.md) and are easily incorporated:

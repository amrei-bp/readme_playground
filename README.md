- [üìô](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) Link to documentation

- ‚úè Or invite them to contribute

Here is a [cheat-sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

## Top contributors:

You can even add the top contributors of your repo to the readme: 

<a href="https://github.com/amrei-bp/readme_playground/graphs/contributors">
  <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=amrei-bp/readme_playground" alt="contrib.rocks image" />
</a>


## License

Make it easy for others to know what they can do with your code and add license information into your readme. Often these are placed at the top of the readme for even easier accessibility. They link to the text of the license (not in your repository, but on the web). 

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Here are some [markdown license badges](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba) you can use.

## Title banner

These you can use for projects, but also for your very own user readme. Easily generated [here](https://leviarista.github.io/github-profile-header-generator/).
